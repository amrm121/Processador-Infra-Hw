Info: Option to preserve fewer signal transitions to reduce memory requirements is enabled
    Info: Simulation has been partitioned into sub-simulations according to the maximum transition count determined by the engine. Transitions from memory will be flushed out to disk at the end of each sub-simulation to reduce memory requirements.
Info: Simulation partitioned into 1 sub-simulations
Info: Simulation coverage is       0.00 %
Info: Number of transitions in simulation is 199
Info: Vector file PC.vwf is saved in VWF text format. You can compress it into CVWF format in order to reduce file size. For more details please refer to the Quartus II Help.
